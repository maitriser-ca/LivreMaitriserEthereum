== Préface

Ce livre est une collaboration entre Andreas M. Antonopoulos et le Dr Gavin Wood. Une série d'heureuses coïncidences a réuni ces deux auteurs dans un effort qui a galvanisé des centaines de contributeurs pour produire ce livre, dans le meilleur esprit de l'open source et de la culture creative commons.

Depuis quelque temps, Gavin souhaitait écrire un livre qui développerait le Livre jaune (sa description technique du protocole Ethereum), principalement pour l'ouvrir à un public plus large que ne le permettait le document original infusé de lettres grecques.

Les plans étaient en cours - un éditeur avait été trouvé - lorsque Gavin avait parlé à Andreas, qu'il connaissait depuis le tout début de son mandat avec Ethereum comme une personnalité notable dans l'espace.

Andreas a récemment publié la première édition de son livre _Mastering Bitcoin_ (O'Reilly), qui est rapidement devenu le guide technique faisant autorité sur Bitcoin et les crypto-monnaies. Dès la publication du livre, ses lecteurs ont commencé à lui demander : "Quand écrirez-vous "Mastering Ethereum" ? Andreas envisageait déjà son prochain projet et trouvait qu'Ethereum était un sujet technique passionnant.

Finally, in May 2016, Gavin and Andreas were both coincidentally in the same city at the same time. They met up for a coffee to chat about working on the book together. With both Andreas and Gavin being devotees of the open source paradigm, they both committed to making this a collaborative effort, released under a Creative Commons license. Thankfully, the publisher, O'Reilly Media, was happy to agree, and the _Mastering Ethereum_ project was officially launched.

=== Comment utiliser ce livre

The book is intended to serve both as a reference manual and as a cover-to-cover exploration of Ethereum. The first two chapters offer a gentle introduction, suitable for novice users, and the examples in those chapters can be completed by anyone with a bit of technical skill. Those two chapters will give you a good grasp of the basics and allow you to use the fundamental tools of Ethereum. <<ethereum_clients_chapter>> and beyond are intended mainly for programmers and include many technical topics and programming examples.

To serve as both a reference manual and a cover-to-cover narrative about Ethereum, the book inevitably contains some duplication. Some topics, such as _gas_, have to be introduced early enough for the rest of the topics to make sense, but are also examined in depth in their own sections.

Finally, the book's index allows readers to find very specific topics and the relevant sections with ease, by keyword.

[[intended_audience_sec]]
=== Public visé

((("intended audience")))This book is mostly intended for coders. If you can use a programming language, this book will teach you how smart contract blockchains work, how to use them, and how to develop smart contracts and decentralized applications with them. The first few chapters are also suitable as an in-depth introduction to Ethereum for noncoders.



[[conventinons_used_sec]]
=== Conventions utilisées dans ce livre

((("typographical conventions")))The following typographical conventions are used in this book:

_Italic_:: Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.

+Constant width+:: Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.

**`Constant width bold`**:: Shows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user.

_++Constant width italic++_:: Shows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or values determined by context.

[[code_examples_sec]]
=== Exemples de code

((("code examples, obtaining and using")))The examples are illustrated in Solidity, Vyper, and JavaScript, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system. All code snippets are available in the GitHub repository under the _code_ subdirectory. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook.

All the code snippets can be replicated on most operating systems with a minimal installation of compilers, interpreters, and libraries for the corresponding languages. Where necessary, we provide basic installation instructions and step-by-step examples of the output of those instructions.

Some of the code snippets and code output have been reformatted for print. In all such cases, the lines have been split by a backslash (+\+) character, followed by a newline character. When transcribing the examples, remove those two characters and join the lines again and you should see identical results to those shown in the example.

All the code snippets use real values and calculations where possible, so that you can build from example to example and see the same results in any code you write to calculate the same values. For example, the private keys and corresponding public keys and addresses are all real. The sample transactions, contracts, blocks, and blockchain references have all been introduced to the actual Ethereum blockchain and are part of the public ledger, so you can review them.


((("attribution")))We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, ISBN, and copyright. For example: &#x201c;__Mastering Ethereum__ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Dr. Gavin Wood. Copyright 2019 The Ethereum Book LLC and Gavin Wood"

=== Adresses et transactions Ethereum dans ce livre

((("blockchain","warnings and cautions")))((("keys and addresses", seealso="cryptography; private keys; public keys")))((("QR codes")))((("transactions","warnings and cautions")))((("warnings and cautions","when using test and example material appearing in book")))The Ethereum addresses, transactions, keys, QR codes, and blockchain data used in this book are, for the most part, real. That means you can browse the blockchain, look at the transactions offered as examples, retrieve them with your own scripts or programs, etc.

((("warnings and cautions","avoid sending money to addresses appearing in book")))However, note that the private keys used to construct the addresses printed in this book have been "burned." This means that if you send money to any of these addresses, the money will either be lost forever or (more likely) appropriated, since anyone who reads the book can take it using the private keys printed herein.

[[acknowledgments_sec]]
=== Remerciements d'Andreas

I owe my love of words and books to my mother, Theresa, who raised me in a house with books lining every wall. My mother also bought me my first computer in 1982, despite being a self-described technophobe. My father, Menelaos, a civil engineer who published his first book at 80 years old, was the one who taught me logical and analytical thinking and a love of science and engineering.

Merci à tous de m'avoir supporté durant cette aventure.

=== Remerciements de Gavin

My mother secured my first computer for me from a neighbor when I was 9 years old, without which my technical progress would no doubt have been lessened. I also owe her my childhood fear of electricity and must acknowledge Trevor and my grandparents, who performed the grave duty of "watching me plug it in" time after time, and without whom said computer would have been useless. I must also acknowledge the various educators I have been lucky to have through my life, from said neighbor Sean (who taught me my first computer program), to Mr. Quinn my primary school teacher, who fixed it for me to do more programming and less history, through to secondary-school teachers like Richard Furlong-Brown, who fixed it for me to do more programming and less rugby.

I must thank the mother of my children, Jutta, for her continued support, and the many people in my life, friends new and old, that keep me, roughly speaking, sane. Finally, a huge dollop of thanks must go to Aeron Buchanan, without whom the last five years of my life could never possibly have unfolded in the way they did and without whose time, support, and guidance this book would not be in as good shape as it is.
